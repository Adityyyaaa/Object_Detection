# YOLO-Object-Detection

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. In this notebook, we will apply the YOLO algorithm to detect objects in images.
Darknet prints out the objects it detected, its confidence, and how long it took to find them. Since we are using Darknet on the CPU it takes around 6-12 seconds per image. If we use the GPU version it would be much faster.


How to run:

1. Open Jupter Notebook/Google Colab in your browser
2. Open the folder containing this folder
3. Run ObjectDetection.ipynb
4. Done!
